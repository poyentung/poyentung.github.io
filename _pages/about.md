I'm a Machine Learning Scientist at [MatNex](https://www.matnex.ai), where I collaborate with a brilliant team of scientists to develop AI-driven methods that accelerate materials discovery — all with the goal of enabling a net-zero future. I drive the development of our discovery pipeline, focusing on active learning and reinforcement learning strategies for efficient exploration.

Before this, I was a Postdoc at [Cambridge](https://www.cam.ac.uk) from 2021 to 2024. I had the pleasure of being affiliated with [Peterhouse](https://www.pet.cam.ac.uk/), the university’s oldest college — a place steeped in history and charm. I got my PhD in Materials Science at [Max Planck Instuitute](https://www.mpie.de/en) under the supervision of [Prof. Dirk Raabe](https://www.mpie.de/person/43164/2763408).

Some of my most notable work before joining MatNex includes the development of DANTE, a general search framework designed to navigate high-dimensional spaces with minimal data. I also co-led the creation of active learning pipelines for high-entropy alloys in 2022, which contributed to a rapid discovery of 2 Invar alloys in just 3 months — published in [Science](https://www.science.org/doi/full/10.1126/science.abo4940). 


<!-- I obtained my PhD in Materials Science from [Max Planck Instuitute for Sustainable Materials](https://www.mpie.de/en), where I was supervised by [Prof. Dirk Raabe](https://www.mpie.de/person/43164/2763408) and [Dr Michael Herbig](https://www.mpie.de/person/43136). My first half of PhD contres around sustainable materials, extending the lifespan of engineering materials and contributing the sustainable development of energy. -->
