I am a [Research Associate](https://www.esc.cam.ac.uk/staff/dr-po-yen-tung) working in [Materials](https://www.emg.msm.cam.ac.uk/) & [Earth Sciences](https://www.esc.cam.ac.uk/) Department at the University of Cambridge. I am also affiliated with [Peterhouse](https://www.pet.cam.ac.uk/), the universityâ€™s oldest college. My academic interests span a broad range of topics, primarily situated at the intersection of physical sciences, materials discovery and machine learning.

<!-- I obtained my PhD in Materials Science from [Max Planck Instuitute for Sustainable Materials](https://www.mpie.de/en), where I was supervised by [Prof. Dirk Raabe](https://www.mpie.de/person/43164/2763408) and [Dr Michael Herbig](https://www.mpie.de/person/43136). My first half of PhD contres around sustainable materials, extending the lifespan of engineering materials and contributing the sustainable development of energy. -->
