I'm a [Research Associate](https://www.esc.cam.ac.uk/staff/dr-po-yen-tung) working in both [Materials](https://www.emg.msm.cam.ac.uk/) & [Earth Sciences](https://www.esc.cam.ac.uk/) Departments at the University of Cambridge. I'm chuffed to bits to be affiliated with [Peterhouse](https://www.pet.cam.ac.uk/), the oldest college at the university - it’s quite a special place! 

My interests are pretty wide-ranging, but I’m especially excited by anything that combines physical sciences, the hunt for new materials, and machine learning. Always up for a chat about these topics, so don’t hesitate to get in touch!

<!-- I obtained my PhD in Materials Science from [Max Planck Instuitute for Sustainable Materials](https://www.mpie.de/en), where I was supervised by [Prof. Dirk Raabe](https://www.mpie.de/person/43164/2763408) and [Dr Michael Herbig](https://www.mpie.de/person/43136). My first half of PhD contres around sustainable materials, extending the lifespan of engineering materials and contributing the sustainable development of energy. -->
